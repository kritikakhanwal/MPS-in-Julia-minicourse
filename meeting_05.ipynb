You'll see next time how it's used in the TEBD algorithm, but you can probably already imagine that it's kinda nice that on each virtual legs you have these Schmidt coefficients $\\lambda$, that immediately tell you everything you would want to know about the entanglement between the two sides of the state separated by this leg. The bond dimension is also obviously the Schmidt rank, which gives us a very concrete, physical characterization of what high bond dimension and low bond dimension mean.\n",

    "As explained in above reference, the form of MPS transfer matrix $T$, i.e. the symmetry it has because of how it consists of $A$ and $A^\\ast$, guarantees that the dominant eigenvectors $l$ and $r$ are Hermitian and positive semi-definite. However, as we discussed in the last meeting, when we numerically ask for the eigenvectors, they come with an arbitrary phase. Last time we modified `normalize!` so that it partially fixes this phase (and also the norm of $l$ and $r$), imposing `vec(l)'*vec(r) == 1`. Your first job is to further modify `normalize!` so that it fully fixes the phases, so that the `l` and `r` it returns are Hermitian and positive semi-definite, in addition to having the property that `vec(l)'*vec(r) == 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you do that? Well, you should definitely start by getting the `normalize!` function from above, and only make small modifications to that. Since we know that $r$ is actually $a \\cdot \\tilde{r}$, where $\\tilde{r}$ is Hermitian and pos. semi-def. and $a$ is a scalar, we can just take the trace $\\mathrm{Tr} r = a \\mathrm{Tr} \\tilde{r}$, and we know that $\\mathrm{Tr} \\tilde{r}$ is something real and positive. Any part of $\\mathrm{Tr} r$ that is not real and positive, is $a$, and you divide $r$ by $a$ to get $\\tilde{r}$. And similarly for $l$."

The expression for the ground state then looks like\n",

    "With these steps, we've gotten rid of all the exponentially large objects in $e^{-\\beta H} | \\psi \\rangle$: The evolution operator is described by local gates, and the state is defined by local MPS tensors. We can then absorb the layers of the circuit into the MPS, layer by layer, contracting only local things at a time. If we assume translation invariance this can all be done at the thermodynamic limit, i.e., with an infinite system. By \"absorbing\" a layer I mean this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/trotter_absorb.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "At the last step the four-valent tensor has been split into two MPS matrices. This can be done by considering it as a matrix from the two left-most legs to the two right-most legs, and performing and a singular value decomposition (SVD).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this method we can keep absorbing layers of the circuit $e^{-\\beta H}$ into our MPS, effectively increasing $\\beta$, until the state doesn't change significantly any more, i.e., until the procedure converges. At the end, our MPS should be the ground state of the Hamiltonian, subject to the caveat that since our $\\tau$ is small, and not exactly zero, and our $\\beta$ is large, and not exactly infinite, we only find the ground state approximately (the error coming from ignoring the $\\tau^2$ terms is called the Trotter error).\n",
    "\n",
    "Seems great! So why don't we get coding? Well, there's one problem here. Every time we use an SVD to split\n",

    "<img src=\"fig/trotter_split.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "we are SVDing a $dD \\times dD$ matrix. This means there are $dD$ singular values, meaning the bond dimension of our MPS after this procedure will be $dD$ (whereas a moment before it was just $D$). So our bond dimension will grow during this procedure, and exponentially too! This is not good.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we never claimed we wanted the exact ground state. What we wanted was a low bond dimension MPS that approximates the ground state. So somehow we should reduce the bond dimension back to what it was, while not changing the state our MPS describes too much (or as little as possible). We should probably take our MPS tensors, that now have some indices ranging over $dD$ values, and throw out some of the elements (like throwing out some columns of a matrix) so that all the dimensions are at most $D$. But which ones do we throw out?\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out, you should always throw out the parts that correspond to the smallest Schmidt values. This is the same result as the fact that the optimal low-rank approximation to matrix is given by its truncated SVD (see Low rank approximation in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular-value_decomposition#Applications_of_the_SVD), since the Schmidt decomposition is just an SVD in disguise. Thus we should be performing this whole iTEBD procedure in the canonical form, so that on each leg we have the Schmidt value corresponding to that bipartition of the state. Then every time we perform one of the SVDs that increases the bond dimension, we can go back to the canonical form and remove from the neighbouring tensors the parts that correspond to the smallest Schmidt values (which has the same effect as setting those values to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus a naive summary of the iTEBD algorithm would be as follows:\n",
    "1. Absorb a layer of the circuit for $e^{-\\beta H}$ into your MPS.\n",
    "2. Use SVDs to transform the network back into an MPS, but now with a larger bond dimension.\n",
    "3. Gauge transform this network into the canonical form.\n",
    "4. Throw out the smallest Schmidt values on some of the legs, to reduce the bond dimension back to $D$.\n",
    "5. Go to 1., unless your state has already converged, i.e., isn't changing any more, in which case we are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that every second time we go through this process, we should absorb a layer of $e^{-\\tau H_{\\text{odd}}}$ and every second time a layer of $e^{-\\tau H_{\\text{even}}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "I call the above summary \"naive\", because I've ignored some details. For instance, the canonical form of your MPS will now have translation symmetry only by two sites, which means you'll have to keep to tensors $\\Gamma_A$ and $\\Gamma_B$ and corresponding two vectors of Schmidt values $\\lambda_A$ and $\\lambda_B$. It also turns out it's not important to be canonicalizing your MPS at every single step: If you start with an MPS in canonical form, you can perform the absorption, SVD and truncation all with recanonicalizing in between, since your MPS will stay close enough to being canonical. You can even repeat this for a few iterations before having to canonicalize again. These kinds of details you should check up on your own from the literature. I mainly recommend<br>\n",
